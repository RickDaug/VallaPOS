# VallaPOS — Project State

> **Read this first.** This is the single source of truth for what exists, what's wired, and what's next. Update it as work lands.

_Last updated: 2026-06-12 — Blueprint + scaffold pass._

## Where we are

The original prototype (one 204-line `app/page.tsx` client component, all mock data, no backend) has been **replaced with a restructured foundation**. This pass delivered the *blueprint + scaffold*: rewritten spec/docs, a real multi-tenant data model, pinned dependencies, and the wiring for database + auth. **No end-user features are built yet** — the register, products, orders, reports, and settings screens are placeholders pending approval to build.

## What exists now

### Docs (the "expectations", rewritten)
- `README.md` — honest overview + quick start
- `docs/PRD.md` — product requirements, personas, scope
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — stack, structure, multi-tenancy, offline, dependency policy
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — MVP → v1 → v2
- `STATE.md` — this file

### Foundation (scaffolded, not yet feature-complete)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — full multi-tenant model: Business, Membership/Role, Category → Item → Variation → ModifierGroup → Modifier, Order/OrderLine/Payment, CashDrawerSession, plus Better Auth tables. **Money stored as integer cents; tax as basis points.**
- `src/lib/env.ts` — zod-validated environment variables (fails fast on misconfig)
- `src/lib/db.ts` — Prisma singleton
- `src/lib/auth.ts` / `src/lib/auth-client.ts` — Better Auth server + client config (scaffold)
- `src/lib/tenant.ts` — `requireMembership()` choke point for tenant isolation + role gating
- `src/lib/money.ts` — integer-cents money math (no floats) + tax/total helpers
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — shared helpers
- `app/` route groups: `(auth)` sign-in/sign-up, `(app)/[businessId]/…` shell + placeholder screens, `api/auth/[...all]` handler
- Pinned `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, ESLint flat config, Prettier, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`

## What is deliberately NOT done yet (awaiting approval)
- Real auth flows (sign-up/in screens are placeholders; Better Auth config needs a real secret + DB)
- The register/checkout screen (cart, modifiers, tender, receipt)
- Products / Orders / Reports / Settings screens
- PWA service worker (Serwist) + offline IndexedDB queue
- Payments (cash drawer logic, then Stripe)
- Seed data, tests, CI

## Key invariants (do not break)
1. **Tenant isolation:** every tenant-owned query goes through `requireMembership(businessId)` and includes `where: { businessId }`. A missing filter = cross-business data leak.
2. **Money is integer cents.** Never use floats for money. Tax rates are basis points (e.g. `825` = 8.25%).
3. **Pin dependencies.** No `"latest"`. Commit the lockfile.
4. **Reads** live in `src/features/*/queries.ts` (server-only). **Writes** live in `src/features/*/actions.ts` (`"use server"`), validated with zod.

## Decisions on record
- Hosting: **Vercel + Neon Postgres** (no separate API server).
- Auth: **Better Auth**, build now; **payments deferred** (cash/manual for v1).
- Browser-POS reality: Tap-to-Pay & Bluetooth readers are native-only → card-present is sequenced to a later native shell; lead with cash + QR/Terminal.

## Next step
Get owner approval on this blueprint, then build the MVP per `docs/ROADMAP.md` (start: schema migration + auth flow + register screen).
